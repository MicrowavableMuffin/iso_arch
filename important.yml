- Dependencies:
  - archiso
- Commands:
  - mkdir archlive:
    purpose: >-
      Create the base image directory as described by the wiki. The care they 
      inspire leads me to believe the name of this folder is hardcoded elsewhere.
    result:
      mkdir: created directory 'archlive'
  - "cp -vr /usr/share/archiso/configs/baseline/* archlive":
    purpose: >-
      Copy the releng base config (maximum options) to the archlive folder.
      This will be the skeleton of our install image.
    result: >-
  - cd archlive:
      purpose: >- 
        enter the build env
      result: no news is good news
  - ls:
      purpose: >-
        Confirm build file locations.
      result: >-
