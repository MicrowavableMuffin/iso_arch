# ArchLinux ISO 

---
__Purpose:__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create and collect a series of base images 
for various causes. Starting with development, I intend to create multiple
 startup profiles. This will be helpful moving people to linux, so we can all
 think about how computers actually work.
